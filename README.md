My story is a choose-your-own story where you can play as a male or female and experience the differences of ages and genders as part of the Spanish Royal family. For the male aspect, it can be seen that it is more lenient on what the men had to do during the Tudor era and as they would study to become a great leader, and also pick a good suitor to rule along with them. As a female you will experience what values being a woman was during the Tudor Era, you would typically grow up to become a housewife for whatever prince, duke, or king would court you, but as the women grew older they slowly lost their value to bear children and would usually be pushed to the side. Some pages include multimedia like photos of important rulers or suitors, and videos that help introduce people from the Tudor Era. Some pages also include colorful text or a difference in word size that varies from passage to passage. My intended audience would be middle schoolers or high school students who are unaware of the life of the people during the Tudor era. Creating a Twine story is a very new concept for me but I believe that I did a good job of never once touching coding before in my life.
